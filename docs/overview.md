# Overview

## Versioning
uSupport adheres to the industry-standard practice of semantic versioning ([semver.org](https://semver.org/)). This ensures predictability in each release, allowing you to anticipate the contents of a release based on the incremented version number. Semantic versioning is a well-established and reliable approach to software versioning.

| Major        | Minor        | Path |

| A version that includes breaking/incompatible API changes.            | A version with one or more new features that have been added. |  A version consisting of minor, non-breaking bug fixes.  |
